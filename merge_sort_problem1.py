#You are given a list of integers and a target sum. Your task is to find all pairs of integers in the list that add up to the target sum and return them as a list of tuples. Each pair of integers should be sorted in ascending order. If multiple pairs have the same sum, they should be sorted based on the first number in the pair.
#Write a function that takes the list of integers and the target sum as input and returns a list of tuples representing the pairs that add up to the target sum.

def merge_sort():
    pass


numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5, 4]
target_sum = 8
#output = [(1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5)]
res = merge_sort()
print()
